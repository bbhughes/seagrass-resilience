Columns A-F"Columns A-F are data for 24 hr grazing trials, I added a few more responses ""diatom_cover"" and ""epiphyte_cover"", which were not in the first analysis"Columns A-F are a separate experiment than the data from the rest of the columns."For, ""Ulva"", ""diatom"" and ""epiphyte"" these values represent % cover for each group. ""epiphyte"" was simply Ulva + diatom.""One treatment, pH 7.58 was not in the original analysis because there was not representation from the ""nutrients added"" treatment so it seemed weird to include. We can try running with or without."Columns H and onwardAfter column G are the raw data from the 24 day mesocosm experimentSom treatments have more reps than others this is due to shoot mortality occuring more in some treatments v. others"Epiphytes are not here, when I looked back at the data it turns out that we weighed out all diatoms in each treatment, so there is no replication within treatments""For shoot length we can convert to ""shoot elongation"" by simply subtracting 20 from the measurement, since 20 cm was our starting shoot length""Rhizomes with na's either meant the plant was dead, or we could not link or find the rhizome. "It it is easier to use non-negative values only then simply add 7 to the rhizome elongation and that will be the total length.
